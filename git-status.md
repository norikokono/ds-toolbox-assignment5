# Definition: git status

[comment]: <> (Specifically, explain what the git status command is useful for. How can you access the same information provided by this command if you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal?)


* Running the command 'git status' in the terminal will display the current state of the files in your working directory and the staging area.


* The side panel in Jupyter Lab displays the status of Untracked, Changed, and Staged files.
